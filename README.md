# My C/C++ Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of my mini projects written in C and C++. Each project is a small, self-contained program that demonstrates various concepts and techniques in C/C++. Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or inspiration for your own projects.

## Project List

1. [**Project 1:** Calculator in C.](Simple-Calculator.c)

   This project is a console-based calculator program implemented in C. It provides various mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, factorial, sine, and cosine. The program displays a menu with options for the user to choose from, and it continues to execute until the user selects the exit option. The calculator uses functions for each mathematical operation, making the code modular and easier to understand. Overall, it's a simple yet effective calculator application for basic mathematical calculations.
3. **Project 2:** Description of project 2.
4. **Project 3:** Description of project 3.
5. [**Project 4:** Math Game in C++.](Simple-Math-Game.cpp)

   This project is a console-based math quiz program implemented in C++. It allows the user to choose the number of questions, the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard, or mixed), and the type of operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, mixed). The program generates random math questions based on the user's choices and evaluates the user's answers. At the end of the quiz, it displays the user's score and whether they passed or failed. The program also offers the option to play the quiz again.
